													Infix to Postfix Conversion
Definition:
Infix to Postfix conversion is the process of transforming a mathematical expression written in infix notation (where operators are placed between operands) into postfix notation (where operators are placed after their operands).

In postfix notation, also called Reverse Polish Notation (RPN), parentheses are not required, and the order of operations is inherently maintained. This notation is easier for computers to evaluate using a stack-based approach.
